*Pronounced [`/ɒmˈnɪks/`](https://ipa-reader.com/?text=%C9%92m%CB%88n%C9%AAks&voice=Geraint)*

Omnix aims to supplement the [Nix](https://nixos.asia/en/nix) CLI to improve developer experience.

## Usage

See <https://omnix.page/>

## Developing

1. [Install Nix](https://nixos.asia/en/install)
1. [Setup `direnv`](https://nixos.asia/en/direnv)
1. Clone this repo, `cd` to it, and run `direnv allow`.

This will automatically activate the nix develop shell. Open VSCode and install recommended extensions, ensuring that direnv activates in VSCode as well.

### Running locally

To run `omnix-cli`,

```sh
just watch # Or `just w`; you can also pass args, e.g.: `just w show`
```

### Nix workflows

Inside the nix develop shell (activated by direnv) you can use any of the `cargo` or `rustc` commands, as well as [`just`](https://just.systems/) workflows. Nix specific commands can also be used to work with the project:

```sh
# Full nix build of CLI
nix build

# Build and run the CLI
nix run
```

### Contributing

>[!TIP]
> Run `just pca` to autoformat the source tree.

- Run `just ci` to **run CI locally**.
- Add **documentation** wherever useful.
    - Run `just doc run` to preview website docs; edit, and run `just doc check`
    - To preview Rust API docs, run `just doc cargo`.
- Changes must accompany a corresponding `history.md` entry.[^cc]
