The `om init` command provides a better `nix flake init` experienced. Specifically, it provides:

1. a registry of flake templates that you can choose from
2. support for template paramters that can be filled in by the user

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The specification for template paramters are yet to be finalized. Until, then the relevant parameter configuration is tied to the registry in omnix repo. See [`crates/flakreate/registry`](https://github.com/juspay/omnix/tree/main/crates/flakreate/registry).
